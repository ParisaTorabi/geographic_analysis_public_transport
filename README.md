# Geographic analysis of public transportation and identifying poorly-covered areas

The objective of this project was to analyze the data of population (based on latitude and longitude) as well as the public transport stops to create a visual or geometric representation of the influence area of each public transport stop, and identify clusters of population that are not being served by the public transport system, allowing for a more detailed understanding of areas where there is a gap in public transport coverage.

In this project, I worked with the following Python libraries to analyze the data and visualize the desired maps:
shapely, sklearn, folium, pandas, geopandas, seaborn
